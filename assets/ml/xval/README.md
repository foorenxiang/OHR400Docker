# Cross-Validation


## Introduction

The functions contained in this folder surround the implementation of various cross-validation procedures both time-series and non time-series in nature. The goal of this is to make such procedures available using a q-like syntax.

## Functionality

Within this folder are two scripts that constitutes the cross-validation procedures which have been implemented to date. These scripts are:

1. Base-level algorithm implementations (These do not include any distribution procedures)
2. Distributed versions of a number of these algorithms. This will be expanded on to include each of the available algorithms.

## Requirements

- embedPy

The Python dependencies for the FRESH library can be installed by following the instructions laid out in the ML-Toolkit level of this library.

## Installation

To test that all the requirements have been installed correctly and the library is ready for use, run the following in console provided the folder `ml` is placed in `$QHOME` using the syntax:

```q
$ q

q)\l ml/ml.q
q).ml.loadfile`:xval/init.q
```

## Documentation

Documentation is available on the [Cross-Validation](https://code.kx.com/v2/ml/toolkit/xval/) homepage.

## Status

The cross-validation library is still in development and is available here as a beta release, further functionality and improvements will be made to the library in the coming months.
